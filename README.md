For GGJ2023, "roots".

I interpreted "roots" in the sense of someone returning to where they came from. So I imagined a cliched video game hero, in the form of a knight, who has to give up their life of battle to return to their aging parentâ€™s home to take over the family business, which happens to be a coffee shop.

The only controls are the arrow keys to move around. Your character will auto-attack. In order to win, you have to reduce your health all the way down to zero, losing all your armor, and then enter the coffee shop. Every time a baddie hits you, you will lose some armor and your health will decrease. When your health reaches zero, be sure to enter the door to the coffee shop before getting hit again, or you will die.

The scoring system is based on how long it takes you to lose your armor and enter the shop. Killing baddies only prolongs your time as a warrior, so each kill will accelerate the flow of time slightly (until a certain maximum).

Occasionally, your father will appear from the window of the coffee shop and drop a coffee power up. The power up will greatly reduce the speed of the baddies, making them easier to bump into. However, it will also make your auto attack trigger randomly, so it is risky to use the power up.
